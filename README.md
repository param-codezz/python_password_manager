# python_password_manager

   --> Before running the code make sure you have python 3.7 or above version installed and do not change code in any line cuz you know it runs
       by luck ;) jk xD... 
   --> Also this password manager is not connected to any online/offline server so there is  100% security...
   --> Do not change the code in system_time() function, else it may return corrupt time values... 
   --> The "password.txt" file will auto-generate in the folder...
   --> Do not delete the "password.txt"  file because it has the passwords saved in it...
   --> If you can see this, then the code will run smoothly...
